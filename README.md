# Spanish Word Cloud Generator

This repository contains a **Streamlit** application that generates Spanish word clouds with custom colors, frequencies, and dimensions. Users can:

- Customize word lists (CSV, semicolon, or newline separated).
- Select a color gradient by choosing one final color, with the initial color automatically derived by darkening the final color.
- Adjust the number of gradient stops and the WordCloud dimensions.
- Preview **five random variations** of the WordCloud.
- **Download** each variation at **full resolution**.
- **Store** and **manage** named runs (configurations) for easy reuse.

## Features

- **Live Preview of 5 Variations**: Each run randomizes word frequencies so you can see different possible layouts.
- **Color Gradient**: Automatically derives a darker shade from your chosen final color to create a smooth gradient.
- **Flexible Word List**: Paste words separated by commas, semicolons, or line breaks.
- **WordCloud Dimensions**: Control the pixel size (width x height) of the generated images.
- **Stored Runs**: Save custom runs with a chosen name, load them later, or delete them when no longer needed.
- **Export Config**: Download a JSON config of your current settings.
